For my 2024 Summer, I began working as a technical intern learning about medical imaging and clinical radiology within Stanford's Radiological Sciences Laboratory. 
Although I had not previously coded very much since middle school, I have been tinkering with languages that I once knew very well and it has come back to me pretty quickly. 
I've been working now with numerous softwares and learned several languages including python, MATLAB, and C++ in respective order of my proficiency with each one.
This module includes many files I've worked on that I feel like I've contributed in some substantial way. 
It does not encompass all coding/debugging/studying/miscellaneous work I have done with the preproc C++ source code or other files.
Enjoy.
